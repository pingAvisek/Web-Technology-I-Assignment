<!-- Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains a heading and two paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags <h1>, </h1>, <p> and </p> in this exercise. As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like.

    Add an unordered list to this web page. An unordered list should look like the following when it is shown by a browser:

        An unordered list can be specified with the tags <ul> and </ul>.

        An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified
        with tags <li> and </li>.

        After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens when you
        convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags <ul> and </ul> with <ol> and </ol>, respectively.

    Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet. -->
